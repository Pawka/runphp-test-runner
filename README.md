# runphp-test-runner

This repository contains simple test runner which was built in 1 hour and fits under 200 code lines.

The tool should not be treated as production ready or used as replacement of other alternatives as PHPSpec or PHPUnit. These tools are far more better :-)

This project was created for learning purpose to showing how different problems met in testing can be solved.
